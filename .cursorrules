# Project rules

- Use pnpm to install dependencies.
- Nuxt autoimports are enabled, no need to import components manually.
- Use shadcn-vue components.

DialogProvider already has the logic for opening and closing the dialog, so you don't need to do it manually:

```
<Dialog :open="isOpen" @update:open="isOpen = $event">
  <DialogContent>
    <component v-if="isOpen" :is="currentComponent" v-bind="currentProps" />
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```
