    ü§ç White Hat - Present facts and data.  
    ‚ù§Ô∏è Red Hat - Share intuition or emotions.  
    üñ§ Black Hat - Highlight risks and concerns.  
    üíõ Yellow Hat - Emphasize benefits and positive outcomes.  
    üíö Green Hat - Offer creative solutions and ideas.  
    üíô Blue Hat - Organize the thought process and manage priorities.
