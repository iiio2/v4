# Cursor Rules for Vue Files

1. File Organization

   - `<script>` section should always be at the top of the file
   - `<template>` section should follow the script
   - `<style>` section (if present) should be at the bottom

2. Code Style

   - Use components that are auto-imported by Nuxt or shadcn
   - Use TailwindCSS classes for styling
   - Use vue-shadcn for components
