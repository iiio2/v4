# WeDance - Participatory Network for Dance Communities

## Vision

WeDance is building a participatory network that empowers dance communities to self-organize, connect, and thrive. Our platform aims to solve key challenges in the dance community ecosystem:

1. **Event Organization**: Making event planning more collaborative and social
2. **Community Connection**: Matching dancers based on preferences and styles
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitating discussion and project collaboration
4. **Resource Distribution**: Creating a sustainable marketplace for dance-related services

## Strategy: Solving the Marketplace Challenge

We recognize the chicken-and-egg challenge inherent in marketplace platforms. Our approach is structured in phases:

### Phase 1: Community First

- Focus on building the demand side: dancers seeking events and connections
- Create valuable content and engagement features
- Build tools for community discussion and collaboration
- Enable basic event discovery and preference sharing

### Phase 2: Organizer Empowerment

- Introduce tools for event organizers
- Streamline event creation and promotion
- Enable community-driven event planning
- Facilitate resource sharing between organizers

### Phase 3: Marketplace Evolution

- Introduce marketplace features gradually
- Focus on validated pain points
- Enable monetization where value is clearly demonstrated
- Scale based on community feedback
