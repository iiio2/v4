# WeDance - Participatory Network for Dance Communities

## Mission

Organize all the worlds information about dance.

## Vision

We want to build Participatory Network to provide autonomy for community: help communities to self-organize and make event organization easier and social, show preferences what you dance and bring dancers together, to discuss ideas in community and bring to life awesome projects.

WeDance is a marketplace. In marketplaces you need to reach critical mass in order to start creating value. That's why it's harder to validate by doing fast "lean startup" tests.

Marketplaces have the chicken and egg problem. Community forum on its own is difficult enough to popularise or rather it's a long time window problem. You have to identify what's the demand side and what's the supply side. Then which part is the one willing to pay to solve its problem. Focus on creating a community on that side with a content engagement, etc. Only then it makes sense to start introducing marketplace mechanics and features. Otherwise it's like entering a huge almost empty hotel.

## WeDance For Dancers

Dance communities use private chats. They are difficult to discover. People who don't use social media are left out. Chats generate too many notifications and get muted. Dance communities need a platform, where it is easy to find and share events, so that it is easier to discover and get less spam.

### Find upcoming events

As a Dancer I want to discover dance events and venues by city, format (party/workshop) and dance style without sign in.

If there are no events in calendar:

- List of organizers
- Ask Locals

Examples of the questions dancers should be able to discover on that page:

When and where is next salsa party?
How can I subscribe to notifications about new salsa events in Munich?
Where can I learn tango? Can I find a dance partner?
Where and when are the next bachata festivals?
What's happening this weekend?
Where can I see recently posted events?
Does anyone know if something is happening? How can I ask local dancers for recommendations?
Who are usually organizing events and where? How can I check pages of organizers and venues?
How do I add new event to calendar? Can anyone add event? Why would I want to do it? What does it cost? (or do I add via my profile or feed?)
How do I recommend event that I found on Facebook?
What’s happening in other city? How can I switch the city?
