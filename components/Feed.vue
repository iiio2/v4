After struggling with body movement isolation, I discovered this effective drill:\n\nThe Mirror Exercise: Stand in front of a mirror and play a slow salsa song. Start by moving only your shoulders for 8 counts, then switch to moving just your hips for the next 8 counts. Keep alternating between shoulders and hips, and gradually increase the tempo as you get more comfortable.\n\nAfter just a week of practicing this for 15 minutes daily, my movement fluidity has improved dramatically! My instructor was impressed with the progress.\n\nTry it and let me know how it works for you!",
