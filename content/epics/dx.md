## Driver

A robust developer experience is crucial for:

1. **Accelerating Development**: Streamlined workflows and tools enable faster feature delivery and bug fixes
2. **Quality Assurance**: Well-documented processes and automated checks help maintain code quality
3. **Team Collaboration**: Standardized practices and clear documentation facilitate better team coordination
4. **Onboarding Efficiency**: Reduced friction for new contributors joining the project
5. **Technical Sustainability**: Long-term maintainability and scalability of the codebase

By investing in developer experience, we aim to create an environment where developers can focus on building value rather than fighting with tooling or unclear processes.
