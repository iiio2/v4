## Driver

Dance communities currently use fragmented private chats and closed groups that make event discovery difficult and exclude potential participants, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient event promotion.

## User Stories

- As a Dancer, I want to browse upcoming events in a calendar view
- As a Dancer, I want to filter events by dance style
- As a Dancer, I want to see event details (time, price, level, location)
- As a Dancer, I want to indicate my attendance (going/maybe)
- As a Dancer, I want to share events with friends
- As a Dancer, I want to see who's going to events

## Success Metrics

- Increase in event discovery (views per event)
- Increase in event participation rates
- Reduced time to find relevant events
- Higher user satisfaction with event discovery
