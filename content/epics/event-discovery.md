## Driver

Dance communities currently use fragmented private chats and closed groups that make event discovery difficult and exclude potential participants, leading to missed opportunities and inefficient event promotion.

## Success Metrics

- Increase in event discovery (views per event)
- Increase in event participation rates
- Reduced time to find relevant events
- Higher user satisfaction with event discovery
