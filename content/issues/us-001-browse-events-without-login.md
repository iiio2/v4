## User Story

As a Dancer,
I want to discover dance events by city, style, and date without signing in,
So that I can easily explore what's happening in the dance community without commitment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Events are visible to non-authenticated users
- [ ] Events can be filtered by city
- [ ] Events can be filtered by dance style
- [ ] Events can be filtered by date range
- [ ] Event cards show key information (title, date, location, style)
- [x] Clicking an event shows full details
- [ ] Search functionality works without login
- [x] Mobile-responsive design

## Technical Notes

- Implement public API endpoints for event discovery
- Use client-side filtering for better performance
- Cache common queries
- Implement rate limiting for non-authenticated users

## Implementation Notes

- Using Nuxt.js with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for responsive design
- shadcn-vue components for UI
- tRPC setup ready for API endpoints
- Need to implement:
  - Database schema for events
  - Search indexing
  - Caching strategy
