# Vision & Strategy

## The Problem

Dance communities face several critical challenges:

- Information fragmentation across private chats and groups
- Difficulty discovering events and finding dance partners
- Information overload and notification fatigue
- Exclusion of non-social media users
- Lack of organized event sharing systems

## Core User Needs

### 1. Event Discovery

- Find relevant dance events easily
- Filter by dance style, location, and date
- See who's going and connect with them
- Share events without spam

### 2. Partner Finding

- Create dancer profiles with style preferences
- Match based on level and goals
- Coordinate practice sessions
- Connect safely within the community

### 3. Community Building

- Organize shared trips to dance festivals
- Create VIP memberships for regular events
- Help newcomers through structured onboarding
- Enable community-driven event curation

## What is a Participatory Network?

A Participatory Network transforms traditional consumer-creator relationships into collaborative partnerships:

- **Bidirectional Creation**: Every member can be both teacher and student
- **Community Self-Organization**: Members coordinate and plan together
- **Value Recognition**: Members' contributions are recognized
- **Collective Ownership**: The community shares in success

## Three Pillars of Participation

### 1. Co-Creation

- Community members shape platform development
- Events are collaboratively organized
- Dance knowledge is collectively curated

### 2. Democratic Access

- Anyone can organize events or share knowledge
- Talent over follower counts
- Equal opportunities to contribute

### 3. Community Value Alignment

- Recognition systems for contributors
- Transparent decision-making
- Community-driven governance
