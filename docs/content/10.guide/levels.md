# Dance Levels

Dance expertise comes in many forms and develops over time. Our level system provides a clear framework for:

- Recognizing dancer and artist expertise
- Matching students with appropriate classes
- Organizing events and workshops
- Setting professional standards
- Supporting growth and progression

This documentation explains how levels work in the application, their practical implementation, and best practices for using them effectively.

## Level vs Class Level

### Personal Level

- Describes an individual's overall expertise and experience
- Used in profiles and artist/dancer classifications
- Reflects cumulative knowledge and skills
- Takes into account multiple aspects (technique, performance, teaching, etc.)
- Example: An "Intermediate dancer" can dance socially and has 2-5 years experience

### Class Level

- Describes the difficulty/content of a specific class
- Used in event and class descriptions
- Focused on specific skills being taught
- More granular and topic-specific
- Example: An Advanced dancer might take "Intermediate Classes" in:
  - A new dance style they're learning
  - Specific techniques they want to improve
  - Styles outside their main expertise

### Examples

1. A Master level instructor might take intermediate classes in a new dance style
2. An Advanced dancer might teach beginner classes
3. An Intermediate dancer might take both:
   - Advanced classes in their strongest moves
   - Beginner classes to perfect fundamentals

This distinction helps users understand that:

- Their overall level doesn't restrict which classes they can take
- It's normal and encouraged to take classes at various levels
- Class level indicates content difficulty, not required dancer level
