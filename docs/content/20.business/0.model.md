# Business Model

This document is based on the [S3 Organization Canvas](https://s3canvas.sociocracy30.org/s3-organization-canvas.html), a template for describing organizational models from Sociocracy 3.0.

### 1. Purpose

Dance communities currently use fragmented private chats and closed groups that exclude many potential participants and generate overwhelming notifications, leading to inefficient event organization and slower community growth, which we aim to solve by organizing the world's dance information and building a participatory network that helps communities self-organize effectively and makes dance more accessible to everyone.

### 2. Core Values

- Community-driven: Enable self-organization and autonomy
- Participatory: Everyone can contribute and benefit
- Transparency: Open information and clear communication
- Trust and Safety: Safe environment for dance communities
- Quality: High standards for content and interactions

### 3. Legal Status and Ownership

Registered as eingetragener Verein (e.V.) - a non-profit association, organized according to Sociocracy 3.0 principles:

- Core Circle: Platform vision, strategy, and resource allocation
- Community Circle: Guidelines, conflict resolution, and cultural development
- Product Circle: Development, architecture, and user experience
- Growth Circle: Community expansion and partnerships

Key benefits of e.V. structure:

- Democratic governance aligned with S3 principles
- Ability to generate revenue through mission-supporting activities
- Tax benefits for non-profit status
- Higher trust from dance communities
- Easier access to grants and public funding
- Lower administrative overhead
