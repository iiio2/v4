Looking at our drivers and immediate needs, we should prioritize hiring based on:

1. **Core Driver**: Need to establish S3 governance and initial structure
2. **Platform Driver**: Need basic platform functionality
3. **Community Driver**: Need to start building first dance style community
4. **Business Driver**: Need to set up legal and financial foundation

Based on this, I recommend this hiring sequence:

1. **First Hire: Technical Lead** (Product Circle)

   - Can start building platform MVP
   - Essential for validating technical decisions
   - Can help evaluate future tech hires
   - Critical for open source foundation

2. **Second Hire: Community Manager** (Community Circle)

   - Focus on first dance style community
   - Build relationships with early adopters
   - Help define community guidelines
   - Start safety protocols

3. **Third Hire: Growth Lead** (Growth Circle)

   - Set up revenue streams
   - Work with early partners
   - Develop pricing models
   - Handle business development

4. **Support Roles** (as needed):
   - DevOps Engineer (once platform basics are ready)
   - Community Moderator (once we have initial users)
   - UX Designer (for refining user experience)

Would you like me to:

1. Detail the job descriptions?
2. Define the interview process following S3?
3. Create onboarding guidelines?
4. Map out the hiring timeline?
