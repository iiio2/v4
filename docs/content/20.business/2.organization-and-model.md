# Organization & Business Model

This document describes how WeDance is organized and operates, following Sociocracy 3.0 principles.

## Purpose & Values

### Purpose

Dance communities currently use fragmented private chats and closed groups that exclude many potential participants and generate overwhelming notifications, leading to inefficient event organization and slower community growth, which we aim to solve by organizing the world's dance information and building a participatory network that helps communities self-organize effectively and makes dance more accessible to everyone.

### Core Values

- Community-driven: Enable self-organization and autonomy
- Participatory: Everyone can contribute and benefit
- Transparency: Open information and clear communication
- Trust and Safety: Safe environment for dance communities
- Quality: High standards for content and interactions
