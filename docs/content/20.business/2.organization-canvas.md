# Organization Canvas

## 1. Purpose

To organize the world's dance information and build a participatory network that helps communities self-organize effectively and makes dance more accessible to everyone.

We aim to solve the fragmentation of dance communities, where information is scattered across private chats and closed groups, leading to inefficient event organization, exclusion of potential participants, and slower community growth.

## 2. Core Values

- **Community-driven**: We enable self-organization and autonomy, believing that communities know best how to serve their needs
- **Participatory**: Everyone can be both creator and participant, contributing to and benefiting from the network
- **Transparency**: All information and decision-making processes are open and accessible
- **Trust & Safety**: We create a secure environment for dance communities to connect and interact
- **Quality**: We maintain high standards for content, interactions, and technical implementation

## 3. Legal Status and Ownership

- Starting as UG (mini-GmbH) with minimal capital requirement
- Equal partnership model with performance-based incentives
- 50% profit reinvestment, 50% partner distribution
