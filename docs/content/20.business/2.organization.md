## S3 Decision Making

We use consent-based decision making following S3 patterns:

1. Present proposal
2. Test for understanding
3. Brief response round
4. Check for objections
5. Integration of objections
6. Celebrate agreement

## Roles

Following S3 patterns, roles are:

- Selected by consent
- Clearly defined with domain and accountabilities
- Regularly reviewed
- Time-bound
- Distributed based on driver and competencies

## Principles

1. **Effectiveness**: Focus on what works
2. **Consent**: No objections = good enough for now, safe enough to try
3. **Empiricism**: Test assumptions through experiments
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Change incrementally
5. **Equivalence**: Involve people in decisions that affect them
6. **Transparency**: Make information accessible
7. **Accountability**: Respond when something is needed

## Getting Involved

1. Identify organizational drivers that matter to you
2. Join circles that respond to those drivers
3. Take on roles that match your competencies
4. Participate in decision making
5. Help evolve our patterns
