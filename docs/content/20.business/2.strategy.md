# Strategy

## Overview

Instead of starting with city+dance style combinations, WeDance will focus on building strong dance style communities first, regardless of location. This approach allows for faster critical mass achievement and stronger network effects.

## Strategic Advantages

1. **Lower Critical Mass Threshold**

   - Easier to achieve critical mass within specific dance communities
   - Shared vocabulary, norms, and needs across locations
   - More focused user base with higher engagement potential

2. **Stronger Network Effects**

   - Leverage existing cross-city connections
   - Built-in network through congresses and international events
   - Natural social connections between practitioners of the same style

3. **Focused Value Proposition**

   - Style-specific features and tools
   - Tailored experience for each dance community
   - Better understanding of specific community needs

4. **Natural Expansion Path**

   1. Deepen presence within specific dance styles
   2. Expand to new cities within the same style
   3. Cross-pollinate to related dance styles
   4. Add city-specific features and cross-style integration

5. **Producer Strategy Benefits**
   - Dance teachers often specialize and have international reach
   - Event organizers can promote across cities
   - Style-specific influencers can become platform evangelists

## Implementation Notes

This approach mirrors successful platform strategies like:

- Facebook (started with colleges)
- Pinterest (started with designers)
- LinkedIn (started with Silicon Valley professionals)

Instead of trying to be everything to everyone in a single city, we focus on being everything to a specific dance style community first.
