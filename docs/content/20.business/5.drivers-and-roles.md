# Drivers, Domains, and Roles

## Primary Drivers

### Community Organization Driver

Dance communities organize their activities through private chat groups and social media, with information scattered across multiple platforms and groups. This leads to missed opportunities, duplicate efforts, and exclusion of potential participants, which limits the growth and effectiveness of dance communities worldwide.

### Trust & Safety Driver

Dance activities involve physical interaction between participants who often meet for the first time through digital platforms. The lack of standardized verification and safety protocols leads to uncertainty and hesitation in participation, which limits the potential for community growth and connection.

### Platform Development Driver

Current dance community platforms are either too generic (social media) or too limited in scope (event listing sites). This results in fragmented user experience and inefficient workflows for organizers, teachers, and venues, which hinders the professional development of the dance industry.

### Business Growth Driver

Dance communities lack sustainable business models to support their growth and development. The reliance on manual processes and ad-hoc solutions leads to revenue leakage and missed opportunities, which prevents the ecosystem from reaching its full potential.
