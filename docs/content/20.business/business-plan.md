## Current Technical Challenges (January 2025)

### Source Code

- Main repository: https://github.com/we-dance/platform
- Current version: v3.14.0

### Performance Issues

- Low PageSpeed scores affecting user experience
- Poor Google Search indexing due to slow content loading
- Need for improved SEO and content accessibility

### Cost Optimization Needed

Current infrastructure costs are unpredictable and high (200-700 EUR) due to:

- Netlify Prerendering causing cascade of operations
- Firebase read operations
- Algolia read operations
- Netlify Bandwidth costs
- Function execution loops from code/logic issues

### Architecture Evaluation (v4 Planning)

1. Database Options

   - Current: Firebase Realtime Database
   - Evaluating: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB
   - Goals:
     - Query optimization
     - Data structure improvements

     - Global accessibility

2. API Architecture

   - Current: Firebase + REST
   - Evaluating:
     - tRPC (already set up)

     - Supabase
   - Focus on real-time capabilities without Firebase dependency

3. Feature Implementation

     - Follow system optimization
     - Event management (‚è≥ 20% complete)
     - Partner finding (üî≤ planned)
     - Booking system (üî≤ planned)

4. Hosting Optimization
   - Current: Netlify + Firebase
   - Evaluating:
     - Hetzner (cost-effective)
     - AWS (global reach)
     - Vercel (performance)
   - Goals:
     - Reduce costs (current: 200-700 EUR/month)
     - Improve global accessibility
     - Optimize performance
     - Simplify architecture

These challenges are driving the development of version 4, focusing on:
