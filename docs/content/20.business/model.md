# The S3 Organization Canvas

### 1. Purpose

Dance communities currently use fragmented private chats and closed groups that exclude many potential participants and generate overwhelming notifications, leading to inefficient event organization and slower community growth, which we aim to solve by organizing the world's dance information and building a participatory network that helps communities self-organize effectively and makes dance more accessible to everyone.

### 2. Core Values

- Community-driven: Enable self-organization and autonomy
- Participatory: Everyone can contribute and benefit
- Transparency: Open information and clear communication
- Trust and Safety: Safe environment for dance communities
- Quality: High standards for content and interactions

### 3. Legal Status and Ownership

Registered as eingetragener Verein (e.V.) - a non-profit association. This provides:

- Democratic structure with community members having voting rights
- Ability to generate revenue through mission-supporting activities
- Tax benefits for non-profit status
- Higher trust from dance communities
- Easier access to grants and public funding
- Lower administrative overhead
- No minimum capital required

Organizing it according to Sociocracy 3.0 principles provides:

- General Circle (members assembly) as highest decision-making body
- Semi-autonomous circles for different domains (events, development, community)
- Double-linking between circles ensures flow of information
- Consent-based decision making in all circles
- Transparent selection process for role holders
- Regular evaluation and improvement of governance

### 4. Key Constraints

- Critical mass needed in each city to create value
- Network effects only work within geographical boundaries
- Trust and safety concerns for in-person meetings
