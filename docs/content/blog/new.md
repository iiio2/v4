# My Journey with AI Agents: Revolutionizing WeDance Development ðŸš€

I have worked every day since the musicality festival with Anichi Perez in Freiburg on the new concept of WeDance.

I couldn't even sleep. And it was an impressive journey as I was not alone. The team of AI agents was helping me. I never had anything like this since I played video games when I was younger. Even Netflix is not so much fun, where you just observe but don't really participate.

I was so hooked! I felt so powerful, like a CEO of a big corporation or even a president. It was so difficult to take any breaks like eating or even the toilet. For the last few days I am going to sleep in the morning... 8am... 10am... Waking up and back to work. 24h a day is not enough.

I think I discovered a new way of working with AI. Outstanding results! Imagine you are doing design, what's the most difficult part? Finding inspirations, lightning demos and alternative solutions. And you need an enormous amount of time for that, and good sources and libraries. Same for marketing, product development, coding. With Claude I get 10 alternative best of the best solutions in seconds! That's a game changer! All I need to do is to decide which option is better. Also not necessarily, I can also ask it to choose and explain.

I am an expert in code, but not an expert in a lot of areas. Now it's not a problem anymore. I have a team of experts who are never tired and super cheap. And they won't get pissed off by anything. I can ask stupid questions. I can get emotional. Doesn't matter. There were a few funny moments, in our conversations. I laughed a lot. I will share them in my channel.

I am planning to shoot a series of YouTube videos about my newly discovered way of working with AI. You can either send me a list of your questions and I will make a video answer, or we have a recorded video call and do it live together. All videos I will post in my channel. Send me your requests in DM.
