## Purpose

Primary Driver: The organization's growth and impact in the dance community is currently limited by technical barriers and lack of efficient tools for event organization and community management. This results in fragmented solutions, manual processes, and missed opportunities for community engagement.

Main Requirement: We need to develop and maintain a robust, user-friendly platform that empowers dance communities to efficiently organize events, connect members, and grow their activities while ensuring security, privacy, and scalability.

## Key Responsibilities

- Design and implement the technical architecture of the platform
- Develop and maintain core features for event management, community tools, and professional services
- Ensure platform security, scalability, and performance
- Implement data privacy and protection measures
- Maintain technical documentation and API specifications
- Review and integrate open-source contributions
- Manage development infrastructure and deployment processes
- Monitor system health and respond to technical incidents
- Implement analytics and tracking for key metrics
