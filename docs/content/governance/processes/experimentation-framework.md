# Experimentation Framework

This framework guides how we run structured experiments to address complex challenges and validate assumptions across all domains.

## 1. Experiment Types

### Learning Experiments

- Testing assumptions
- Exploring user behavior
- Validating market needs
- Technical feasibility studies

### Innovation Experiments

- New feature concepts
- Process improvements
- Business model tests
- Community engagement approaches

### Optimization Experiments

- Performance improvements
- Resource utilization
- User experience refinements
- Cost reduction strategies

## 2. Safety Guidelines

### Resource Protection

- Dedicated experiment budget per domain
- Clear resource limits per experiment
- Isolated testing environments
- Data backup requirements

### Risk Management

- Impact assessment before start
- Rollback procedures
- User communication plans
- Data privacy safeguards

## 3. Experiment Structure

### Design Phase

1. Clear hypothesis statement
2. Success metrics definition
3. Resource requirements
4. Timeline and milestones
5. Risk assessment
6. Rollback plan

### Implementation Phase

1. Small-scale pilot
2. Data collection plan
3. Progress monitoring
4. Regular checkpoints
5. Stakeholder updates

### Evaluation Phase

1. Data analysis
2. Learning documentation
3. Next steps planning
4. Knowledge sharing

## 4. Support Resources

### Tools and Infrastructure

- Experiment tracking system
- Analytics platforms
