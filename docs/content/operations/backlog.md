following S3 how our documentation should be organized and what do we need

---

Looking at our drivers and immediate needs, we should prioritize hiring based on:

1. **Core Driver**: Need to establish S3 governance and initial structure
2. **Platform Driver**: Need basic platform functionality
3. **Community Driver**: Need to start building first dance style community
4. **Business Driver**: Need to set up legal and financial foundation

Based on this, I recommend this hiring sequence:

1. **First Hire: Technical Lead** (Product Circle)

   - Can start building platform MVP
   - Essential for validating technical decisions
   - Can help evaluate future tech hires
   - Critical for open source foundation

2. **Second Hire: Community Manager** (Community Circle)

   - Focus on first dance style community
   - Build relationships with early adopters
   - Help define community guidelines
   - Start safety protocols

3. **Third Hire: Growth Lead** (Growth Circle)

   - Set up revenue streams
   - Work with early partners
   - Develop pricing models
   - Handle business development

4. **Support Roles** (as needed):
   - DevOps Engineer (once platform basics are ready)
   - Community Moderator (once we have initial users)
   - UX Designer (for refining user experience)

Would you like me to:

1. Detail the job descriptions?
2. Define the interview process following S3?
3. Create onboarding guidelines?
4. Map out the hiring timeline?

i would like to design a process of communication between me (or other team member) and you. so you will be representing different actors (experts), we need to list them somewhere. and you need to know who are you speaking to. and you need to guide people what to do next. maybe we need a daily routine? like when someone comes to work they say "hi" to you and your first role will be secretary. what you think? do it with .cursorrules file.
