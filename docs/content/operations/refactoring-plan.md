# Refactoring and Data Migration Plan

## 1. Schema and Interface Reorganization

- Consolidate all schemas into a single location
- Align all mock data with correct interfaces
- Ensure data type consistency

## 2. tRPC Integration

- Migrate all mock data to be loaded through tRPC
- Implement corresponding tRPC routes
- Update client-side code to use tRPC queries

## 3. schema.org Standardization

- Analyze current interfaces
- Identify corresponding schema.org types
- Adapt existing interfaces to schema.org standards
- Update data type documentation

## 4. Data Structure Analysis

- Compare data schemas between:
  - v3 version
  - Current Prisma schema
  - v4 version
- Create a difference matrix
- Develop data migration strategy

## 5. Database Setup

- Deploy PostgreSQL
- Configure Prisma
- Create migrations
- Test data migration

## Risks and Dependencies

- Potential incompatibility of some data types with schema.org
- Need to maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Time investment for mock data migration to tRPC

## Next Steps

1. Create refactoring branch
2. Start with schema consolidation
3. Prepare test scenarios
4. Conduct architecture review
