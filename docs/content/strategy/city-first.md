# City-First Growth Strategy

## Overview

The city-first strategy focuses on building strong, localized dance communities one city at a time, rather than trying to grow everywhere simultaneously. This approach allows us to create vibrant micro-communities that can serve as proof points and templates for expansion.

## Core Principles

### 1. Focus & Depth Over Breadth

- Concentrate resources and attention on one city until reaching critical mass
- Build deep relationships with local dance organizers, teachers, and venues
- Create a complete ecosystem before expanding to new locations

### 2. Local Leadership

- Identify and empower local community champions
- Form partnerships with established dance organizations
- Create a local advisory board for each city

### 3. City Selection Criteria

- Existing dance scene size and diversity
- Number of regular dance events
- Presence of dance schools and venues
- Local cultural factors and dance interest
- Population density and demographics
- Potential early adopters and community leaders

## Implementation Framework
