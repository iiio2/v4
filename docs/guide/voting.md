# Voting

For WeDance, a Reddit/StackOverflow style up/down voting system could be valuable for certain post types. Let's analyze:

Would Benefit from Up/Down:

1. **Discussions**

   - Help surface best answers
   - Quality control for advice
   - Community moderation

2. **Reviews**

   - Validate review accuracy
   - Surface most helpful reviews
   - Community trust building

3. **Ask Locals**

   - Verify accuracy of local information
   - Surface best recommendations
   - Quality control for scene info

4. **Articles**
   - Surface quality content
   - Community curation
   - Knowledge validation

Reasoning:

- Only content that benefits from quality ranking gets voting
- Events/Projects/Travel don't need voting (they're factual)
- Ads/Gigs are business posts, not appropriate for voting
- Polls already have their own voting mechanism
