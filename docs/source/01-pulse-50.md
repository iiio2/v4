# Check your Pulse #50

Happy Sunday friends,

Last week, I was a guest on the Unseen Unknown podcast, where I spoke to Jasmine about customer happiness, how brands need to rethink how they create/extract value, and the forthcoming participatory economy. It was a great conversation, and was the inspiration for today‚Äôs issue. Give it a listen!

Issue #48 on the participatory economy seemed to strike a chord with readers. It was the most popular issue to date, with over 25,000 views:

The problem with the subscription economy is there is no opportunity for fans to own assets, and further, subscription models don‚Äôt take into account the value that fans bring to their communities. While it‚Äôs still a nascent space, there are a few companies building in what I call ‚Äúthe participatory economy‚Äù ‚Äî where fans participate in a creator‚Äôs success.

Zooming out, the participatory economy is a useful framework to understand how many industries are evolving.

Before the Internet, information and power were controlled by gatekeepers that chose what to publish, produce, and distribute. The creator and the consumer were passive, and existed primarily to serve the industrial machine.

Tech-enabled Internet platforms removed many gatekeepers, but introduced new ones. Almost as quickly as social media emerged, influencers were born. With the advent of social media, brands were able to connect directly with their customers, spawning a direct-to-consumer retail movement. But being able to talk to your customer is very different than being able to talk with them. Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook have helped brands build a unidirectional relationship with their customers, but for all the talk of customer empowerment, the resulting relationship is still top down.

üëÜüèΩThe Participatory economy can be understood as filling empowerment gaps and evolving our thinking from consumers as users to customers as people.
In the participatory economy, the creator is bidirectional because the customer is also a creator. The participation can happen in several ways:

The customer participates in the creation of the product

The company‚Äôs core product enables more people to participate, thereby democratizing the nodes of influence

The customer is aligned with the network‚Äôs upside and participates in the financial rewards

1. The customer participates in the creation of the product
   Brands are increasingly empowering customers by making them partners in the brand-building process and letting them inform the product roadmap.

Emily Weiss, the founder of Glossier, credits the company‚Äôs success to their belief that every single person is an influencer. Arfa, founded by the former COO of Glossier, rewards a collective of customers co-piloting the development of the brand with 5% of profits. Nide, a French beauty brand, goes a step further ‚Äî customers submit ideas and receive 500 euros if they have potential. If it gets enough community votes, customers earn 1,500 euros. And if the product is co-created, the customer receives 10% of sales.

2. The company‚Äôs core product enables more people to participate, thereby democratizing the nodes of influence
   Storr is a marketplace where people buy from people instead of retailers. Public is a social investing app that lets you follow friends and domain experts, letting anyone share what they are investing in and their investing strategies. Startups upending traditional education can also be understood through the lens of the participatory economy. Schools have historically been about top-down instruction. But models like Prenda, Primer, and Pioneer empower learners and put them at the center. Everyone can participate in Pioneer, as long as they have a project and an internet connection:

A new wave of social networks is eschewing one-way broadcast in favor of two-way dialogue, with companies like Circle, Geneva, Mighty Networks, and Commsor increasingly powering the infrastructure for digital micro-communities. Ohana builds a community around your podcast, taking your podcast from a monologue to a dialogue. ForgeFiction allows fiction fans to create new original stories and fictional worlds. Ficto gives viewers the power to make narrative decisions. Souffle is a new Q&A app featuring debates on tech where all answers are temporarily anonymous, incentivizing people to vote for the best answer because of the merit of the argument, not because of who the author is.

In many ways TikTok is the best example of a participatory network. As noted by Eugene Wei, ‚ÄúThe TikTok algorithm acts as a rapid, efficient market maker, connecting videos with the audiences they‚Äôre destined to delight. The algorithm allows this to happen without an explicit follower graph.‚Äù The removal of a follower graph prioritizes creativity and talent over reach, democraitizing and unlocking participation.

3. The customer is aligned with the network‚Äôs upside and participates in the financial rewards
   Networks are slowly evolving from being intermediaries that take a commission on each transaction, causing participants to resent them, to being collectively owned platforms that reward contributors, making users more committed.

With more aligned incentives, networks that give their contributors economic incentives will grow faster.

Twetch is a Twitter alternative where you earn money for your content. Braintrust is the first user-controlled talent network that connects organizations with highly skilled tech talent. Delphia helps users monetize their data by turning it into an investment advantage

As participatory models emerge and evolve, they will drive growth in another area: tools that support them.
Some ideas:
Proof of Discovery for Fans: Media is still in search of a business model. Disappointment with ad-based models spawned the rise of subscription media. But it‚Äôs all but clear that charging $10 a month to give your audience more content is the right model. Almost nobody wants ‚Äúmore‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven of a newsletter they love. As Josh Spector said, ‚ÄúIf your most valuable stuff doesn‚Äôt go in your paid product, then you‚Äôre essentially charging people for a product that‚Äôs worse than your free offering which isn‚Äôt a recipe to make people want to pay. And on the flip side, if your best stuff goes in your paid newsletter then your free version may struggle to attract the new people you need in order to keep growing.‚Äù But what if content was available for everyone to read and consume, but not for everyone to participate? What if subscribing to a creator on Substack didn‚Äôt unlock exclusive posts but instead generated a sense of membership and identity that you could brag about? When you support someone, what you really want to signal is ‚ÄúI found this creator‚Äù. In that case, creating systems that honor the labor of discovery and fandom seem like an area worth exploring. (This was inspired by Julian‚Äôs post, Proof of X, which is worth your time.)

Collaborative governance tools: As more companies look to involve customers in decision-making, they need better tooling. Tools like Canny and Upvoty enable roadmap sharing, but they are feedback, not co-creation tools. There is an opportunity to introduce better tooling with features such as built-in polling, voting, and rewards.

Carta for cooperative mechanics: What does a company like Carta or Pulley look like when you are distributing value across tens of thousands of people, and reacting in real-time to contributions and other variables? There are token-based apps, like Props and Roll, but I continue to think the UX is suboptimal.

A paradoxical truth in business is that most companies spend little time focused on their customers. The beauty of the participatory economy is that it‚Äôs not only about what makes sense for publishers, advertisers, creators, teachers, etc‚Ä¶ but also listening to the people on the other side (students, fans, readers, shoppers) and honoring them as people, not users.
